<p>Incredible times, non-standard actions?
According to economists, the rate of purchase of Bank Negara bonds has slowed and there is still room for further rate cuts if needed.

There is also enough liquidity in the market for the government to absorb. Interest rates remain cheap, with the trading yield for the 10-year MGS (coupon 3.885%) at 2.72% on September 24, but above 2.51% on August 24 and 2.6% on July 24. , show data from the central bank.

While low oil prices and falling global demand affected Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) 's profits, the national oil company still had RM 156.86 billion in cash as of June 30, compared with RM 141.62 billion. End of 2019.</p> 
<p>In other words, the surrogate sign is the answer to how much governments have to spend to protect people's lives and livelihoods and to boost growth to prevent permanent damage to the economies of a world ravaged by Covid-19 - particularly as a revival of cases forces a new round of blockades.

In times of crisis, when there is real pain and a need to increase budget spending by governments around the world, it is not difficult to see the pull of the modern heterodox monetary theory (MMT) that claims it. National budgets are different in that they have complete control over their own currency and can therefore print the amounts they need to achieve full employment and stimulate economic growth - for some politicians who want to "save" voters with helicopter money.

Given the pandemic, some observers believe the government may have little room for maneuver - provided markets can be assured that the safeguards are in place to ensure that measures are temporary.

<p>However, major economists disagree, and warn of the risk of hyperinflation and erosion of the value of one's currency resulting from such monetary pressure - even if the goal is to survive the recession results.

"Using quantitative measures would not only risk inflation, but could negatively impact the ringgit, which is not a reserve currency like the US dollar. The potential losses from losing confidence in the ringgit and its economic impact would outweigh the benefits of depressing bond yields. "This has the potential to open up floods that can be difficult to close," said an experienced economist.

"The local financial system still has a lot of liquidity and investors remain confident in buying Malaysian bonds, resulting in low bond yields in the country following the decline in the country's interest rates. I see quantitative moves as negative rather than positive at the central bank. It is better for the Malaysian government to bite the finger and ensure that every penny spent is worth its value and has a big impact on the economy. "In addition, it is better for the government to raise money from the market than to rely on State Bank to buy their bonds," the economist added.</p>
